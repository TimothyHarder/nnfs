Neural Networks become "deep" when they have 2 or more hidden layers.
Despite the name, you will often use the values in these layers to diagnose issues or improve your neural network.

Each weight set is associated with its distinct neuron. So if we have 3 weight sets, we have 3 neurons

To add another layer, we must make sure that the expected input to that layer matches the previous layers output.
Each new layer can have as many weight sets as we want it to have, (as this defines how many neurons we want in the
layer), but the number of distinct weights in each set must match the number of neurons or inputs from the previous
layer.

Linear data can be fit with or represented by a straight line.

Non-linear data cannot be represented well by a straight line.

Linear data are very easily approximated by far simpler machine learning models than neural networks.
What other machine learning algorithms cannot approximate so easily are non-linear datasets.
